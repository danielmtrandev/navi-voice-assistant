### How It's Made:

Tech used: React.js, Material UI, News API, Alan API, Vanilla Javascript

### Optimizations:

Currently trying to add more functionality on top of what I had learned so far.


### Lessons Learned:

I had the most fun making this app due to the sheer amount of utility that Alan API offered.

This was one of my first introductions to React and it was a great learning experience, despite it being overwhelming at some points. 

There is still so much to unpack from this project that I still revisit this to learn more as I build out other small React apps.

Thank you JS Mastery and Alan AI devs for this cool project inspiration!
